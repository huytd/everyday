# 01.19.2022 - Rust/The Never Type

Rust has a special type `!` to imply that there is no return value. Usually called _never type_.

It allows us to write code like this:

```rust
let num = match input.parse::<f32>() {
    Ok(num) => num,
    Err(_) => {
        println!("ERROR: Cannot parse the given input!");
        return;
    }
};

println!("Parse successfully!");
```

We expect the `num` variable to have the type `f32` if the input is successfully parsed into an `f32`. But in case of parsing error, we want to print something on the screen and gracefully exit the application (instead of crashing it).

Although all branches of a `match` statement should return the same data type, because the return type of `return` is a `!`, Rust can guess the type of `n`. The type `!` can be coerced to any other type.

In the code above, when the `Err` case happens, the value of `num` will never get assigned, and the execution also stops after the `let num` statement, the last `println!` statement will never reach.

Other than `return`, the `break`, `continue`, `exit` and `panic!` expressions also have `!` type.

One more practical example usage of `!` is when you are asking a number from the user, and only continue the execution if the input is valid:

```rust
let mut buffer = String::new();
let mut done = false;
while !done {
    println!("Please enter a valid number: ");
    std::io::stdin().read_line(&mut buffer).unwrap();
    let num = match buffer.trim().parse::<i32>() {
        Ok(num) => num,
        Err(_) => continue
    };
    println!("The number is: {}", num);
    done = true;
}
```
