# 12.24.2021 - Scala/Partial Applied Function

Like currying, if a function takes some arguments and we invoke that function without all of the arguments, a new function will be created so we can call it with the remaining functions later on.

In Scala, it is called Partial Applied Function, and we can call it with the place holder like this:

```scala
def sum(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b

val add5 = sum(5, _)

def main(args: Array[String]): Unit =
  print(add5(10))
```

In JavaScript, it is equivalent to `bind` method:

```javascript
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;

const add5 = sum.bind(null, 5);

debug(add5(10));
```
