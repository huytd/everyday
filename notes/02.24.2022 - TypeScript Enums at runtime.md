# 02.24.2022 - TypeScript/Enums at runtime and tree-shaking

In TypeScript, an enum can be defined in various ways: a numeric enum, a string-based enum, or heterogeneous enum.

By default, any enum member will have a numeric value:

```typescript
enum Fruit {
    Orange,
    Apple,
    Mango
}

// equivalent to

enum Fruit {
    Orange = 0,
    Apple  = 1,
    Mango  = 2
}
```

A string-based enum is an enum where its members have string values:

```typescript
enum Fruit {
    Orange = "cam",
    Apple  = "táo",
    Mango  = "xoài"
}
```

A heterogeneous enum is the type of enum where you can have a mix between numeric and string values.

---

Numeric enums are compiled to JavaScript in the following form:

```typescript
var Fruit;
(function (Fruit) {
    Fruit[Fruit["Orange"] = 0] = "Orange";
    Fruit[Fruit["Apple"]  = 1] = "Apple";
    Fruit[Fruit["Mango"]  = 2] = "Mango";
})(Fruit || (Fruit = {}));
```

It's a bit too much to look at this compiled code, but what it exactly does is create a `Fruit` object and assign a couple of values to this object:

```typescript
Fruit["Orange"] = 0;
Fruit["Apple"]  = 1;
Fruit["Mango"]  = 2;

Fruit[0] = "Orange";
Fruit[1] = "Apple";
Fruit[2] = "Mango";
```

These assignments allow the enum to be accessed in various ways:

```typescript
// Static lookup
Fruit.Orange // = 0

// Dynamic lookup
Fruit['Apple'] // = 1 
Fruit[Fruit.Orange] // = "Orange"
Fruit[2] // = "Mango"
```

In the case of string-based enum, the generated code is much more straight-forward:

```typescript
var Fruit;
(function (Fruit) {
    Fruit["Orange"] = "cam";
    Fruit["Apple"] = "táo";
    Fruit["Mango"] = "xoài";
})(Fruit || (Fruit = {}));
```

You can only dynamically access the enum members via a string:

```typescript
// Static lookup
Fruit.Orange // = "cam"

// Dynamic lookup
Fruit["Mango"] // = "xoài"
```

---

The wrapping function around each compiled enum is called IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression):

```typescript
(function (Fruit) {

})(Fruit || (Fruit = {}));
```

What it does is capture a local variable `Fruit` that either points to a pre-defined `Fruit` or a new empty object `Fruit || (Fruit = {}`. One of its applications is to allow you to split the enum into multiple declarations.

For example, we split the enum `Fruit` into two parts:

```typescript
enum Fruit {
    Orange = "cam",
    Apple  = "táo",
    Mango  = "xoài"
}

enum Fruit {
    Durian = "sầu riêng"
}
```

This compiles to:

```typescript
var Fruit;

(function (Fruit) {
    Fruit["Orange"] = "cam";
    Fruit["Apple"] = "táo";
    Fruit["Mango"] = "xoài";
})(Fruit || (Fruit = {}));
//           ^^^^^ Fruit is a new object {}

(function (Fruit) {
    Fruit["Durian"] = "sầu riêng";
})(Fruit || (Fruit = {}));
// ^^^^^ Fruit is referenced to the existing Fruit
```

The usage of IIFE is useful here but with a drawback, during production build, [tree-shaking](/everyday/02-09-2022-javascript-named-imports-and-dead-code-elimination) is impossible to check if this generated code is being used or not, hence, these enums will always appear in the bundled code, even if you are not using them anywhere.

---

If an enum is prefixed with a `const`, there will be no generated code for this enum at all, because every usage of this enum's value will be inlined with its actual value, for example, the following code:

```typescript
const enum Fruit {
    Orange = "cam",
    Apple  = "táo",
    Mango  = "xoài"
}

console.log(Fruit.Apple);
console.log(Fruit.Mango);
```

Will be compiled to:

```
console.log("táo" /* Apple */);
console.log("xoài" /* Mango */);
```

This approach has a clear performance benefit but comes with some pitfalls, make sure you [check them in the document](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html#const-enum-pitfalls) before using it.
