# 04.05.2022 - TypeScript/Some random notes about Classes

Some notes about some not-so-well-known things about TypeScript Classes.

## Parameter properties

In TypeScript, you can define a class's properties in two ways: Define it as a class property in the normal way, or define it as a constructor's parameter, a.k.a Parameter Properties:

```typescript
class Foo {
    private bar: Bar;
    public beep: Boop;

    constructor() {}
}

// is equivalent to

class Foo {
    constructor(
        private bar: Bar,
        public beep: Boop
    ) {}
}
```

You probably use this a lot if you've been writing Angular code:

```typescript
@Component({ ... })
class SomeComponent {
    constructor(
        private apiService: ApiService,
        ...
    ) {}
}
```

## Static blocks in class

You can define a static block in a class, it is useful when you need to do some initialization for static members of the class.

For example, you want to init some static values for the class, you cannot init it in a constructor, because it's just wrong:

```typescript
class Foo {
    static bar = 0;
    constructor() {
        Foo.bar = calculateSomethingComplex();
    }
}

console.log(Foo.bar); // output = 0
```

The right way to do this is, to use a `static` block:

```typescript
class Foo {
    static bar = 0;
    static {
        Foo.bar = calculateSomethingComplex(); // 50
    }
}

console.log(Foo.bar); // output = 50
```

## Classes are just shapes

For most of the cases, classes in TypeScript are compared structurally, this means, as long as the classes have the same shape, you can use them interchangeably:

```typescript
class Foo {
    x: number;
    y: string;
}

class Bar {
    x: number;
    y: string;
    z: boolean;
}

let x: Foo = new Bar(); // OK
let y: Bar = new Foo(); // Fail
```

In the above example, the **Bar** class has all the members of **Foo**, so it can be assigned to a variable of type **Foo**, but not the other way around because the **Foo** class doesn't have the `z: boolean` property.

This means, you can also assign an empty class to anything, but it does not mean you should do it.
