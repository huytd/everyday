# 02.12.2022 - Parsing/Backus-Naur Form and variants

**Backus-Naur Form (BNF)** is a metasyntax for [context-free grammars](/everyday/02-10-2022-parsing-context-free-grammar), is used to describe the syntax of languages used in computing such as programming languages, instruction sets,...

## The BNF syntax

The specification of BNF is quite simple, it's a set of derivation rules written as:

```bnf
<symbol> ::= expression1 | expression2
```

Where:

- `<symbol>` is the nonterminal, they are always enclosed between the pair `<>`
- `expressions` consists of one or more sequences of either terminals or nonterminals.
- `::=` mean the symbol on the left must be replaced by the expression on the right.
- If a nonterminal can be replaced by multiple expressions, they can be separated by the vertical bar "|"

For example, the following grammar define a signed integer number:

```bnf
<signed integer> ::= <integer> | <sign> <integer>
<integer> ::= <digit> | <integer> <digit>
<digit>  ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
<sign>   ::= -
```

## The Extended BNF syntax

There are many variants of BNF, one of the most popular variants is **Extended BNF (EBNF)**. It added some other symbols so we can explain the grammar better, like the sequence symbol (`,`), repeated symbol (`{}`), optional symbol (`[]`),...

In EBNF, nonterminal does not necessarily enclose between the pair `<>`, and the definition symbol `::=` can be written as `=`. Terminals are strictly enclosed within the quotation marks (`""` or `''`). Each production rule is terminated by the semicolon `;`, and they can contain comments (`(* *)`) too:

```bnf
(* this is a comment *)
digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
```

A concatenation symbol is used to express the sequence of terminals, each separated by a comma (`,`), for example:

```bnf
twelve = "1", "2" ;
ten = "1", "0" ;
one ten = "1", ten ;
```

If a symbol needed to be repeated (zero or more times), we can use `{}` symbols. For example, the following definition matches all powers of ten, including 10, 100, 1000, 10000,...

```bnf
powers of ten = one, zero, { zero } ;
one  = "1" ;
zero = "0" ;
```

Optional can be expressed by `[]`, everything that is optional can be present just once or not at all, for example:

```bnf
signed digit = [ "-" ], digit ;
digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
```
