# 02.01.2022 - HTML/Auto-fill OTP code from SMS

Safari on iOS and macOS devices have the ability to automatically retrieve and autofill the OTP code sent via SMS if your input has the `autocomplete="one-time-code"` attribute:

```html
<form action="/verify-otp" method="POST">
    <input type="text"
           inputmode="numeric"
           autocomplete="one-time-code"
           pattern="\d{6}"
           required>
</form>
```

To make the SMS OTP more secure, you should compose the SMS message with the origin-bound:

```
Your OTP is 123456

@app-01.huy.rocks #123456
```

The origin bound is a string containing two parts. The domain name is preceded with `@`, and the OTP is preceded with `#`.

When the device receives the SMS, the OTP code will be auto-filled only if the domain matches your website's domain.

For non-iOS devices, OTP autofill also works but not with the `autocomplete="one-time-code"` attribute. We should use WebOTP API instead.

```javascript
navigator.credentials.get({
    otp: {transport:['sms']}
})
.then(otp => input.value = otp.code);
```
