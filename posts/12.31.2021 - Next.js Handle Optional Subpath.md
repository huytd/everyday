# 12.31.2021 - Next.js/Handle Optional Subpath

In Next.js, you can define a [dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes) by creating a file at `/pages/post/[id].tsx`. And this will catch all URLs like `/post/foo`, `/post/bar`,...

But if you want to catch URLs like `/post`, you will have to create another file at `/pages/post/index.tsx`.

One other way to catch all URLs including `/post/<anything>` and `/post`, you can create a file like `/pages/post/[...id].tsx`.

And to catch all URLs with multiple levels like `/post`, `/post/<anything>`, `/post/<anything>/<any>/<level>/...`, create a file like `/pages/post/[[...id]].tsx`.
