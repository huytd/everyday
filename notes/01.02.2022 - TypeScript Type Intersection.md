# 01.02.2022 - TypeScript/Type Intersection

Let's say, we are building a component to display some images (with lazy loading):

```javascript
const LazyImage = (props: ImageProps) => {
	...
}
```

And this component takes some properties (`ImageProps`) that came from the two imaginary types:

```javascript
type ImageSource {
	imageUrl: string;
	preloadUrl?: string;
}

type ImageMetadata {
	fileSize: number;
	width?: number;
	height?: number;
}
```

The most inefficient way is to redefine everything from `ImageSource` and `ImageMetadata` into a new type `ImageProps`:

```javascript
type ImageProps {
	imageUrl: string;
	preloadUrl?: string;
	fileSize: number;
	width?: number;
	height?: number;
}
```

The better way to do it, is to define a new `ImageProps` that is an intersection between `ImageSource` and `ImageMetadata` with the `&` operator:

```javascript
type ImageProps = ImageSource & ImageMetadata
```

The order of the types when declaring an intersection doesn't matter, so this will also work:

```javascript
type ImageProps = ImageMetadata & ImageSource
```
