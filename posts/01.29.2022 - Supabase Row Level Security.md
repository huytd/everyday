# 01.29.2022 - Supabase/Row Level Security with application user

In Postgres, tables can have [Row Level Security](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html) that restrict the user's action on each row.

With Supabase, we can create a policy that matched the current logged in user, this user is from the application level, not the database user:

```sql
create policy "Users can update their own profiles."
  on profiles for update using (
    auth.uid() = id
  );
```

The `auth.uid()` here is just a Postgres function provided by Supabase to extract the application's current user. See its implementation here: [supabase/auth-schema.sql#Line 77-78](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/ddac1147354a386342e825cbfb70ec63775e6a2b/docker/dockerfiles/postgres/auth-schema.sql#L77-L78).
