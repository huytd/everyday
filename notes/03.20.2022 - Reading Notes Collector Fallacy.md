# 03.20.2022 - Reading Notes/Collector's Fallacy and the cure

Collector's Fallacy is **the urge to collect something that you never use or need**, but the act of collecting gives you a good feeling (cognitive reward).

For example:
- Save every article on the internet that you think it's interesting
- Buy every book you found
- Buy stuff that you never actually needed 

It is called a fallacy because when you collect something and do not spend time reading or processing it, you [**know about it, but do not actually know it**](/everyday/03-07-2022-reading-notes-two-types-of-knowledge).

Some tactics to combat the Collector's Fallacy:

- **"Own" before you collect:** Sit down and process the information before you move on with the next item. Or plan some few hours a day to go over your inbox and process the pending items here.
- **Do a monthly purge:** Don't be afraid to delete items off the reading list if they're not excited you anymore. Do it periodically, maybe once a month.
