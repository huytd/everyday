# 04.09.2022 - Golang/Use Delve on M1 Mac

[Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/Documentation/installation) is a GDB-alike debugger for Golang, with better support for Go's data structures and Goroutine.

To install Delve on M1 Mac devices, you first need to install the Go ARM64 version, then install Delve with:

```
$ go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest
```

If you use the Go version for Intel chip, your Go programs still compile but Delve won't work, and you will need to recompile after installing the correct version.

To start debugging a program with Delve, go to your project's folder and run:

```
$ dlv debug
```

From here, you can put a breakpoint at the beginning of the `main()` function with:

```
break main.main
```

The above command means, putting a breakpoint at the beginning of the `main` function, in the `main` package. You can also put a breakpoint by line with `b <line>` command, or a breakpoint at any package's function with `b <package>.<fn>`.

Now, you can start the program with the `continue` (or `c`) command.

As you step through the code, use the key `n` to go to the next line, `s` to step in to a function.

To examine the local variables of scope, use `locals` command, or print the value of any expression with `print <expr>` or `p <expr>` command.
