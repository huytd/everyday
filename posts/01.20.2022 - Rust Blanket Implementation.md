# 01.20.2022 - Rust/Blanket Implementation

By using generic parameters, you can `impl` a trait for any type that satisfies some trait bounds, for example, implement trait `ToString` for every type `T` that implemented the `Display` trait:

```rust
impl<T: Display> ToString for T {
    ...
}
```

This technique is called _**blanket implementation**_. It's being used widely in Rust standard library.

You can even omit the trait bound to implement your trait for every type:

```rust
mod foo {
    pub trait Foo {
        fn bar(&self) {
            println!("Foo::Barrrrrr!!!");
        }
    }
    impl<T> Foo for T {}
}

use foo::Foo;

let i = 10i32;
i.bar();
```
