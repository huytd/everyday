# 02.18.2022 - JavaScript/Beware the delete

Unlike C/C++, the [delete](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete) operator in JavaScript has nothing to do with memory deallocation.

What it actually does is **remove a property from its parent object**. If there is no more reference to that property, it will be marked as [unreachable](https://javascript.info/garbage-collection#reachability) and will be released when the garbage collector (GC) runs.

In the following example, delete `foo.b` will mark the string "yolo" as unreachable, and it will eventually be released from the memory:

```javascript
let foo = {
    a: 12,
    b: "yolo"
};

delete foo.b;

// foo = { a: 12 }
```

But in a scenario when two objects shared the same reference, things might not work as you expected.

```javascript
let boo = { c: true };

let foo = {
    a: 12,
    b: boo
};

let bar = {
    b: boo
};

// foo = { a: 12, b: { c: true } }
// bar = { b: { c: true } }

delete foo.b;

// foo = { a: 12 }
// bar = { b: { c: true } }
```

The string `boo` is shared between `foo` and `bar` as the property `b`, when you delete the reference `foo.b`, the string `boo` is still being referenced in `bar.b`, so it's still reachable. Hence, nothing will be deleted when the GC runs.

In strict mode, when the `delete` command is called and the target could not be deleted, a `SyntaxError` will be thrown. If running in non-strict mode (also known as [sloopy mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Sloppy_mode)), a `false` value will be returned instead.

When a property is created as [non-configurable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete#non-configurable_properties), it cannot be deleted, and a `TypeError` will be raised instead.

```javascript
'use strict';

var bar = {};
Object.defineProperty(bar, 'hello', { configurable: false });
delete bar.hello; // TypeError


var foo = {};
Object.defineProperty(foo, 'goodbye', { configurable: true });
delete foo.goodbye; // this works fine
```

A variable defined with `var` is either belongs to a scope of the function it's defined in, or the global scope (if not defined inside any function).

When defined in the global scope, a variable is added as a non-configurable property to the global object. So, it cannot be deleted.

```javascript
'use strict';

// global scope
var hello = "world";
delete globalThis.hello; // Type Error
delete hello; // Syntax Error, see below
```

Also, in strict mode, if `delete` is used on a direct reference to a variable, function argument, or a function name, it also throws a Syntax Error:

```javascript
'use strict';

var b = 'xyz';
delete b; // Syntax Error

let c = "hello";
delete c; // SyntaxError:

const d = 15;
delete d; // SyntaxError

function hello(x) {
    delete x; // Syntax Error
}

function hello() {}
delete hello; // Syntax Error
```

Deleting a variable defined with `var` inside a function is also does not works:

```javascript
'use strict';

function hello() {
    var x = "what's up?";
    delete x; // Syntax Error
}
```

---

In non-strict mode, if you define a variable without the `var` keyword, it will be added to the global object as configurable, hence, we can delete it:

```javascript
awesome = true;
delete awesome; // true
```

And if you delete something that does not exist, it also returns true!

```javascript
delete somethingDoesNotExist; // true!!!
```

Did you hate the `delete` yet? Let me make you hate it more.

If you `delete` an element from an array, it will be gone, but the length of the array is unchanged:

```javascript
let arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'];

<shape of arr> = {
    0: 'a', 1: 'b', 2: 'c',
    3: 'd', 4: 'e', 5: 'f',
    length: 6
}

delete arr[3];

<shape of arr> = {
    0: 'a', 1: 'b', 2: 'c',
    4: 'e', 5: 'f',
    length: 6
}
```

This makes perfect sense based on the way `delete` works, but it will be a lot of pain if someone has to debug array issues because you deleted an element from the array this way.

The right way to remove an element from an array is either to set it to `undefined` or use `Array.prototype.splice`:

```javascript
arr[3] = undefined;

<shape of arr> = {
    0: 'a', 1: 'b', 2: 'c',
    3: undefined, 4: 'e', 5: 'f',
    length: 6
}

arr.splice(3, 1);

<shape of arr> = {
    0: 'a', 1: 'b', 2: 'c',
    3: 'e', 4: 'f',
    length: 5
}
```
