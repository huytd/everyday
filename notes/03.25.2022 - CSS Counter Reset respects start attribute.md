# 03.25.2022 - CSS/List counter-reset and the start attribute

In CSS, we can create a custom list numbering with `counter-reset`, `counter-increment` and `counter()` functions.

For example:

```css
ol {
    counter-reset: olcounter;

    li {
        counter-increment: olcounter;

        &::before {
            content: counter(olcounter) ". ";
        }
    }
}
```

This approach works fine for most of the continuous list, for example:

```html
<ol>
    <li>first item</li>
    <li>second item</li>
    <li>third item</li>
</ol>
```

But sometimes, you will have a list with a much more complex structure, the HTML structure would not be continuous. For example, when using a markdown generator on the following content:

```markdown
This is a list:

1. First item
   
   Another line here
   
2. Second item
   
   Some more lines
   Ok?
   
3. Third item
```

The generated HTML structure would be broken up into multiple `<ol>` tags. They are technically multiple lists, but each of them has the `start` attribute to specify the start value of the list. So they would look like a continuous list.

```html
<ol start="1">
    <li>
        <p>First item</p>
        <p>Another line here</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
    <li>
        <p>Second item</p>
        <p>Some more lines</p>
        <p>Ok?</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
    <li>
        <p>Third item</p>
    </li>
</ol>
```

If we are using the CSS style defined from the beginning of the post, the rendered list would look wrong, all the list items will start with 1 instead of incrementing:

```
1. First item
   
   Another line here
   
1. Second item
   
   Some more lines
   Ok?
   
1. Third item
```

The reason for this behavior is, we are resetting the counter at the beginning of each `<ol>` element.

```css
ol {
    counter-reset: olcounter;
}
```

To fix the problem, we should ignore the counter reset if the `start` attribute is presented, it can be done with the following CSS selector:

```css
ol {
    counter-reset: olcounter;

    &[start] {
        counter-reset: none;
    }
}
```

Please note that this approach does not really respect the value of the `start` attribute. If you want to make `counter-reset` respect the value of the `start` attribute, a possible approach is to use JavaScript to inline the style for each `<ol>` element, like this:

```javascript
const olWithStarts = document.querySelectorAll("ol[start]");

olWithStarts.forEach(ol => {
    const start = ol.getAttribute('start');
    ol.style = 'counter-reset: olcounter ' + start;
});
```
