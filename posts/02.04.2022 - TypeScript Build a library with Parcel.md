# 02.04.2022 - TypeScript/Build a library with Parcel

With Parcel 2.0, it's very easy to build a TypeScript library and publish them to NPM later on, with automatically generated types and built-in support for both CommonJS and ESModule.

Let's say you have a library file located at `src/lib.ts`:

```typescript
export const sum = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;
```

You want to publish this library as an NPM package, so everyone can use it, all you have to do is modify your `package.json` to add the `source`, `main`, `module`, and `types` sections:

```json@focus=4:7
{
  "name": "your-package-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "source": "src/lib.ts",
  "main": "dist/main.js",
  "module": "dist/module.js",
  "types": "dist/types.d.ts",
  "devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.0.0",
    "typescript": "^4.5.5"
  }
}
```

The `source` field defines where your package's entry point is.

The `main` field defines the main target of the build, which is the `dist/main.js` file.

The `module` field is to support ESModule.

And finally, the `types` field tells Parcel to generate a type definition `.d.ts` file for your library.

Run the build command:

```
npx parcel build
```

If everything went well, you can publish your package to NPM now.
