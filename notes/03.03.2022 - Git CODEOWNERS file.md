# 03.03.2022 - Git/CODEOWNERS file

On Github, you can create a `CODEOWNERS` file in the `.github/` or `docs/` folder to specify which person or team is responsible for the code in a repository.

If a file or a folder has a code owner, their name will be displayed when someone views the file on Github. All the involved code owners can also be automatically suggested as a reviewer when you open new pull requests.

The syntax of the `CODEOWNERS` file is similar to the `.gitignore` file, but you need to specify the owner (an individual or a team) next to an entry:

```
*.js @frontend-team

*.test.js @huy

.github @sre-team

apps/app-01 @david
apps/app-02 @ben @david

ui/components/dropdown/* @maki
ui/components/forms @huy @maki
```

More details can be found in the official document on [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners) or [Gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/code_owners.html).
