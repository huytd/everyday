# 01.11.2022 - Zig/Build system

There are 4 build modes in Zig, each can be enabled via the arguments `-O ReleaseSafe`, `-O ReleaseSmall`, and `-O ReleaseFast` when running `zig run` or `zig test`.

Depending on which mode is enabled, runtime safety checks (things like number overflow check,...) and optimizations will be enabled or disabled

|Build mode|Runtime Safety|Optimization|
|:---------|:--------------|:------------|
|Debug     |Yes            |No           |
|ReleaseSafe|Yes           |Yes, Speed   |
|ReleaseSmall|No           |Yes, Size   |
|ReleaseFast|No            |Yes, Speed   |

To build your code into an executable, use `zig build-exe`, it's also possible to cross-compile and build executable for different platforms in Zig too.

Zig also has `zig build` command, which will compile your program based on a `build.zig` file. Run `zig init-exe` or `zig init-lib` to create an empty project with `build.zig` script.

A basic Zig project will have the following structure:

```
.
├── build.zig
└── src
    └── main.zig
```

When `zig build` is triggered, the build runner will run the function `build()` in your build script as an entry point, the file look like this:

```zig
const Builder = @import("std").build.Builder;

pub fn build(b: *Builder) void {
    // Default build target and mode, will take the information
    // from the zig build command. You can override if you want.
    const target = b.standardTargetOptions(.{});
    const mode = b.standardReleaseOptions();

    // Build the executable file
    const exe = b.addExecutable("init-exe", "src/main.zig");
    exe.setTarget(target);
    exe.setBuildMode(mode);
    exe.install();

    // And run it afterwards
    const run_cmd = exe.run();
    run_cmd.step.dependOn(b.getInstallStep());

    const run_step = b.step("run", "Run the app");
    run_step.dependOn(&run_cmd.step);
}
```

The executable will be created at `./zig-cache/bin` by default.
