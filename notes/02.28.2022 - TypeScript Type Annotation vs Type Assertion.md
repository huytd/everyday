# 02.28.2022 - TypeScript/Type Annotation vs Type Assertion

By default, the TypeScript compiler tries its best to analyze the code and infer the type of your variables.

```typescript
let a = 10; // typeof a == number
let b = "hello"; // typeof b == string
```

**Type Assertion** is when **you tell the compiler that you know a variable has a specific type, so it doesn't have to make a guess**:

```typescript
let a: any = 10;
let b = a as number;
```

This might be helpful in some cases when TypeScript does not have enough information about the type of some values, for example:

```typescript
const parsedData = JSON.parse(data) as SomeType;

// or

const ref = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
```

**Type Annotation** is when **you tell the compiler that a variable is expected to have a specific type, and if it's not, it should be a bug**:

```typescript
let a: number = "hello"; // Error!

type Foo {
    one: string;
    two: number;
};

let b: Foo = { one: "hello", two: 10 }; // OK
```

---

Using type assertion might be helpful in some cases, but it will weaken the type checking feature of TypeScript. Let's take a look at the following example:

```typescript
let a = { one: "hello" } as Foo; // No error

let b: Foo = { one: "hello" }; // Error
```

As mentioned earlier, TypeScript will try to infer the type for both `a` and `b`, and in this case, both have the shape of `{ one: string }`.

Since we convinced TypeScript that the type of `a` is `Foo`, even if this **seems** to be a mismatch, TypeScript will trust you and ignore the type error. It's not the case for `b`, TypeScript knows that we are expecting a type `{ one: string, two: number }` instead of a `{ one: string }`.

Note that, if the shape of `a` is clearly mismatched with `Foo`, TypeScript will be able to stop you:

```typescript
let a = { one: "hello", two: "world" } as Foo; // Error
```

So, it's a best practice to prefer type annotation over type assertion in most cases.
