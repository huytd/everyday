# 03.28.2022 - React/Memorization with React.memo

[Memorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) is the technique to let an expensive function return the cached value if all of its arguments remain unchanged.

When a React component is wrapped inside a [`React.memo`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo), the render result of that component will be memorized. If you pass the same props, React will skip re-rendering that component.

Let's take a look at this example: We create a component `Book` that takes a string as `title`. And an _"Update"_ button.

```typescript
const BookComponent = ({ title }) => {
    console.log("Render book with ", title);
    return <div>{title}</div>;
};
const Book = BookComponent;

const DemoApp = () => {
    const [title, setTitle] = React.useState("Hello, World!");
    const update = () => {
        setTitle("Hello, World!");
    };
    return (
    <div>
        <Book title={title} />
        <button onClick={update}>Update</button>
    </div>
    );
};
```

Every time you click the _"Update"_ button, we update the `title` state, the `Book` component will always be re-rendered, even if the `title` value remains the same.

To keep the `Book` component from being re-rendered, we can wrap it with `React.memo`:

```typescript
const Book = React.memo(BookComponent);
```

Now, when updating the state, the `BookComponent` will be called, but the input props have been memorized before, so React will skip rendering.

By default, `React.memo` only do a shallow comparison on the props, this means, if the input prop is an object, the memorization will be broken.

For example, instead of taking a `title` string, we change the `BookComponent` to take an object instead:

```typescript
const BookComponent = ({ book: { title } }) => {
    console.log("Render book with ", book.title);
    return <div>{book.title}</div>;
};
const Book = React.memo(BookComponent);

const DemoApp = () => {
    const [data, setData] = React.useState({
        book: {
            title: "Hello, World!"
        }
    });
    const update = () => {
        setData({
            book: {
                title: "Hello, World!"
            }
        });
    };
    return (
    <div>
        <Book data={book} />
        <button onClick={update}>Update</button>
    </div>
    );
};
```

Clicking _"Update"_ will always result in a re-render. In this case, we can provide `React.memo` a custom comparison function:

```typescript
const compare = (prevProps, currentProps) => {
    return prevProps.book.title === currentProps.book.title;
};

const Book = React.memo(BookComponent, compare);
```

Now, memorization will work again.

It's a best practice to only use `React.memo` on complex components or components that do not require an update when props change.
