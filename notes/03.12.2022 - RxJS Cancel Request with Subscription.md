# 03.12.2022 - RxJS/Cancel Request with Subscription

In RxJS, a [Subscription](https://rxjs.dev/guide/subscription) is an object that represents an execution of an [Observable](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable). It has the most important method, the `unsubscribe()`, mainly used to cancel the execution.

For example, we usually make API calls like this:

```typescript
this.apiService.post(`/upload`).subscribe(response => {
    // upload complete
})
```

This works fine if our API call run to complete. But what happens if the user cancels the operation in the middle of the API call? For example, the user decided to close the upload dialog.

We can handle such case like this:

```typescript
startUpload() {
    this.upload$ = this.apiService.post(`/upload`);
    this.upload$.subscribe(response => {
        // upload complete
    });
}

cancelUpload() {
    if (this.upload$) {
        this.upload$.unsubscribe();
    }
}
```
