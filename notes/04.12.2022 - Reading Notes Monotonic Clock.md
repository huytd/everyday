# 04.12.2022 - Reading Notes/Wall Clock and Monotonic Clock

In a computer system, there are 2 types of clocks: 

1. **Wall Clock** (or **Real-Time Clock**): is the clock that is synchronized with NTP (Network Time Protocol), which is subjected to jump (moving forward or backward) depending on the time server.
2. **Monotonic Clock**: is the clock that is guaranteed to only move forward, regardless of the time server. The frequency rate of this clock might vary, it can be adjusted if the system detects the local quartz is moving faster or slower than the NTP. But it's guaranteed to always move forward.

Go's documentation suggested that we should use **wall clock** only to *tell the time*, and use **monotonic clock** to *measure the time*.

When measuring performance or doing something that relies on the orders of time, we should not use **wall clock**, for example, a common mistake when measuring time in JavaScript is using **Date.now()**:

```javascript
const start = Date.now();
doSomeWork();
const end = Date.now();
const elapsed = end - start;
```

Because **Date.now()** is using **wall clock**, if the system time jumps between the measurement, the **elapsed** time will be incorrect.

This is why in JavaScript, it is recommended to use **performance.now()**, which is based on the **monotonic clock** for performance measurement.

```javascript
const start = performance.now();
doSomeWork();
const end = performance.now();
const elapsed = end - start;
```

**Monotonic clock** time can be obtained in some other languages like:

- **std::time::Instant** in Rust
- **time.monotonic()** in Python
- **time.Sub(startTime)** in Golang
- **hrtime** in NodeJS

It is important to note that, **monotonic clock** is only correct locally. In a distributed system, it is a different topic.
