# 01.03.2022 - React/Render a component to any DOM node with React Portals

In React, you can mount a component into any DOM node instead of just the current parent component, with the help of `ReactDOM.createPortal([content], [node] )`.

It's very helpful when working with modal dialogs or tooltips.

For example, the following `MooContainer` component will create a portal in `document.body`, with the content is the `MooContent` component:

```javascript
const MooContent = () => <div>Moooooo!</div>;
const MooContainer = () => {
  return ReactDOM.createPortal(<MooContent />, document.body);
};
```

Regardless of where we will mount `MooContainer`, the `MooContent` will always be rendered in `body`:

```javascript
const App = () => {
  return <div>
    Hello
    <MooContainer />
  </div>;
};
```

Output:

```html
<body>
  <div id="root">
    <div>Hello</div>
  </div>
  <div>Moooooo!</div>
</body>
```

Using this method, only the HTML structure of the document will be affected and there are no changes in terms of the React's component structure, so, the hierarchy of your component should still be:

```
 App
  ├─ div
  └─ MooContainer
      └─ MooContent
```

Event bubbling will respect this hierarchy, from `MooContent` to `MooContainer` then `App`.

Accessibility wise, since `MooContent` is rendered under `document.body`, keyboard navigation or screen reader's flow will also be affected by this HTML structure, so make sure you handled them properly by yourself.
