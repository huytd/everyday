# 03.07.2022 - Reading Notes/Two types of Knowledge

**Article:** https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/

There are 2 types of knowledge:

- Knowing the name of something
- Understand something

With a full understanding of something, you will be able to use that knowledge to make new connections and generate new insights.

The key difference is, when you fully understand something, you can explain it easily in simple terms, and in an insightful way.

If you only know about something, you will probably don't fully understand it. And when you talk about it, your talk will be seen as a fact-deficient (lack of quality or information) form, and in some cases, overuse of jargon or buzzwords (without further explanation), just to cover up our lack of understanding.
