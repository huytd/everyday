# 01.07.2022 - Zig/Cross-compile C/C++ and Zig programs

Zig came with a built-in C/C++ compiler `zig cc` and `zig c++`. So you can compile and run your C/C++ code with Zig!

For example, let's compile this simple C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello, World!!!");
  return 0;
}
```

```
zig cc hello.c -o hello
```

What's more interesting is, cross-compiling works out of the box with Zig's C compiler, for example, you can compile the above `hello.c` program for MacOS:

```
zig cc -target x86_64-macos -o hello-mac hello.c
```

Or for Linux:

```
zig cc -target x86_64-linux-musl -o hello-linux hello.c
```

It does not just work for this toy C program, but also for many C/C++ projects, for example, Zig's author Andrew Kelley showed how he compiled LuaJIT and test them via QEMU in his article:  https://andrewkelley.me/post/zig-cc-powerful-drop-in-replacement-gcc-clang.html

And not only Zig's C/C++ compiler, but the Zig compiler itself can do cross-compile by supplying `-target` param:

```
zig build-exe -target x86_64-linux-musl hello.zig
```
