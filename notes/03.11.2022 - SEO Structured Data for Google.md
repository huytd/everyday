# 03.11.2022 - SEO/Structured Data for Google Search

**Structured data** is a special data snippet you can insert into your page to help Google Search identify your content in a richer way (called **Rich Result**). It usually comes in the [JSON-LD format](https://json-ld.org).

For example:

```javascript
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
    "@context": "https://schema.org/",
    "@type": "Recipe",
    "name": "Party Coffee Cake",
    "author": {
        "@type": "Person",
        "name": "Mary Stone"
    },
    "datePublished": "2018-03-10",
    "description": "This coffee cake is awesome and perfect for parties.",
    "prepTime": "PT20M"
}
</script>
```

You can use Google's [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) tool to debug your structured data.

There are many different types of rich results like Article, Book, Carousel, FAQ, Event,...
