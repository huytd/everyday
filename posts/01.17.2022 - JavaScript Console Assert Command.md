# 01.17.2022 - JavaScript/Console Assert Command

The built-in `console` come with the `console.assert` method, which is pretty useful to write some test in your code.

This method has the syntax of:

```javascript
console.assert(assertion: bool, msg: string, obj1: any, obj2: any,...)
```

When the `assertion` expression returns `false`, the execution will be stopped, and the `msg` string will be printed out after the `"Assertion failed:"` message. You can format the `msg` just like how you format strings in languages like C++, using any `obj` followed after `msg`.

Otherwise, the execution continues.

For example:

```javascript
const actual = 10;
const expected = 15;
console.assert(actual === expected, "Expected %d. Got %d", expected, actual);
console.log("All good!);
```

Result:

```
Assertion failed: Expected 15. Got 10
```

If we change `actual = 15`, the output on the screen will be:

```
All good!
```
