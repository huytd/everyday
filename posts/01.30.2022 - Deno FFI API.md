# 01.30.2022 - Deno/Introduction to FFI API

From version 1.13, Deno introduced the FFI API (foreign function interface API) that allows us to load libraries built in any language that supports the C ABI (like C/C++, Rust, Zig, Kotlin,...).

To load the library, we use the `Deno.dlopen` method and supply the call signature of the functions we want to import.

For example, create a Rust library and export a method called `hello()`:

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub fn hello() {
    println!("Hello! This is Rust!");
}
```

Specify the crate type in `Cargo.toml` and build it with `cargo build`:

```ini
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```

In debug mode, the output library will be located at `target/debug/librust_deno.dylib`, where `rust-deno` is the project name.

Load this library in Deno with the following code:

```typescript
const libName = './target/debug/librust_deno.dylib';

const dylib = Deno.dlopen(libName, {
    "hello": { parameters: [], result: "void" }
});

const result = dylib.symbols.hello();
```

Finally, run it with Deno, we have to specify the `--allow-ffi` and `--unstable` flags:

```
deno run --allow-ffi --unstable demo.ts
```

We will see the output on the screen:

```
Hello! This is Rust!
```

Notice how we have to specify the call signature of the `hello()` function when importing it from Rust:

```typescript
"hello": { parameters: [], result: "void" }
```

In reality, you might not want to export and import things manually between Rust and Deno, when it comes to more complex data types like string, things get messy.

Let's take a look at our new `hello` method, we want to pass a string as a pointer from Deno to Rust, this means, we have to pass along the length of the string too:

```rust
use core::slice;
use std::ffi::CStr;

#[no_mangle]
pub fn hello(ptr: *const u8, len: usize) {
    let slice = unsafe { slice::from_raw_parts(ptr, len) };
    let cstr = unsafe { CStr::from_bytes_with_nul_unchecked(slice) };
    println!("Hello, {}!", cstr.to_str().unwrap());
}
```

Now, the Deno code:

```typescript
const libName = './target/debug/librust_deno.dylib';

const dylib = Deno.dlopen(libName, {
    "hello": { parameters: [ "pointer", "usize" ], result: "void" }
});

const nameStr = "The Notorious Snacky";
const namePtr = new Uint8Array([
    ...new TextEncoder().encode(nameStr),
]);
const result = dylib.symbols.hello(namePtr, nameStr.length + 1);
```

Let's see what's going on here. On the Rust side, we take a `*const u8` pointer and a length of the string, then convert that pointer into a Rust string with some **unsafe** codes. From the Deno side, we have to encode the string to a byte array and pass the pointer of that array to the Rust code.

The [deno_bindgen](https://github.com/denoland/deno_bindgen) project offered a convenient way to work with data types across the language boundaries, just like _wasm-bindgen_ in Rust WASM.

First, import the `deno_bindgen` crate in your Rust code:

```ini
[dependencies]
deno_bindgen = "0.4.1"
```

Don't forget to install the `deno_bindgen-cli` tool, because we are going to use this tool to build instead of `cargo`:

```
deno install -Afq -n deno_bindgen https://deno.land/x/deno_bindgen/cli.ts
```

Now, in your Rust code, just export or use things as normal:

```rust
use deno_bindgen::deno_bindgen;

#[deno_bindgen]
pub fn hello(name: &str) {
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);
}
```

Run `deno_bindgen` to build your code, the output will be a `bindings/bindings.ts` file in your project's root:

```
deno_bindgen
```

And in your Deno code, simply import the function and call it:

```typescript
import { hello } from './bindings/bindings.ts';

hello("The Notorious Snacky");
```

Finally, run the code:

```
deno run -A --unstable demo.

# Hello, The Notorious Snacky!
```

The new FFI API opened up a lot of possibilities for Deno/TypeScript, for example, there are projects like [deno_sdl2](https://github.com/littledivy/deno_sdl2) that allows us to create native SDL2 applications using Deno and TypeScript, no more Electron!
