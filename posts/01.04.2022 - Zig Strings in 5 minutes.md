# 01.04.2022 - Zig/Strings in 5 minutes

Just like C/C++, you can define a string in Zig with an array of bytes or as a null-terminated string literal.

```javascript
var s = "hello"; // *const [5:0]u8
var s = [_]u8{'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'}; // [5]u8
```

You can reference to any byte in the string just like an array:

```javascript
var s = "hello";
s[2] == 'l' // true
```

Or reference to a substring as a slice:

```javascript
s[1..3] == "ell"
s[1..] == "ello"
```

Note that these references are to the bytes not the characters:

```javascript
var s = "ƒê";
s[0] == '\c4'
s[1] == '\90'
```

For better Unicode supports, you should look at libraries like [zigstr](https://github.com/jecolon/zigstr) and [ziglyph](https://github.com/jecolon/ziglyph).

You can use the array concatenation `++` operator to combine two strings together:

```javascript
const a = "hello";
const b = "world";
const c = a ++ b;
c == "helloworld" // true
```

Get the length of a string by `.len`:

```javascript
var len = c.len;
len == 10 // true
```

Since Zig is a very simple language, there's nothing such as built-in String type, so you gotta manipulate strings manually, just like C. But you can use some help from `std.mem`.

For example, we can use `std.mem.indexOf` to find the byte offset of some content in a string:

```javascript
var found = std.mem.indexOf(u8, c, "w");
found == 5 // true
```

Or if you want to split a string into multiple substrings, `std.mem.split` will return an iterator for it:

```javascript
var s = "hello world this is a test";
var splits = std.mem.split(u8, s, " ");
while (splits.next()) |chunk| {
  std.debug.print("{s}\n", .{chunk});
}
```

The output would be:

```
hello
world
this
is
a
test
```

When `s` is defined as a string literal, they will be stored as a null-terminated byte array in a global data section in the executable after compilation process. And what you get is a pointer to that byte array `*const [N:0]u8` (`N` is the length of the string and `:0` indicates null termination).

And you can't mutate the literal string's content like this:

```javascript
var s = "good morning";
s[0] = 'm'; // error: cannot assign to constant
```

In order to do so, you must dereference it with `.*` operator, a new copy of the string will be created as an array so you can mutate it:

```javascript
var s = "good morning".*;
s[0] = 'm';
s == "mood morning" // true
std.mem.reverse(u8, s);
s == "gninrom doom" // true
```

Also, you can dynamically create a formatted string with `std.fmt`:

```javascript
const allocator = std.heap.page_allocator;
var distance: i32 = 7857;
var str = std.fmt.allocPrint(allocator, "SJC-SGN Distance = {d} miles", .{distance}) catch "format failed";
```
