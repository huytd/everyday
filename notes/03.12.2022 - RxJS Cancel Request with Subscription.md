# 03.12.2022 - RxJS/Cancel Request with Subscription

In RxJS, a [Subscription](https://rxjs.dev/guide/subscription) is an object that represents a disposable resource, it can be used to stop an [Observable](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable).

For example, we usually make API calls like this:

```typescript
this.apiService.post(`/upload`).subscribe(response => {
    // upload complete
})
```

This works fine if our API call run to complete. But what happens if the user cancels the operation in the middle of the API call? For example, the user decided to close the upload dialog.

The Subscription object has the `unsubscribe()` method to stop an Observable, we can handle such case like this:

```typescript
startUpload() {
    this.upload$ = this.apiService.post(`/upload`);
    this.upload$.subscribe(response => {
        // upload complete
    });
}

cancelUpload() {
    if (this.upload$) {
        this.upload$.unsubscribe();
    }
}
```
